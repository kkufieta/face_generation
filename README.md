# Face Generation using GANs
In this project, I trained a [Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) to generate faces, based on the [CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html).

The model was trained using a GPU and TensorFlow 1.1.0.

The full project is accessible in this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/kkufieta/face_generation/blob/master/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb).

This project was part of the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).
